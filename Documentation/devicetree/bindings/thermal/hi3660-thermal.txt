* Temperature Sensor on hisilicon hi3660 SoC

** Required properties :

- compatible: "hisilicon,thermal-hi3660".
- reg: physical base address of thermal sensor and length of memory mapped
  region.
- #thermal-sensor-cells: Should be 1. See ./thermal.txt for a description.

Example :

	tsensor: tsensor {
		compatible = "hisilicon,thermal-hi3660";
		reg = <0x0 0xfff30000 0x0 0x1000>;
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
	 };
